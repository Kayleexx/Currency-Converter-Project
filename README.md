# Currency Converter Project

Different countries use different currencies, and their exchange rates fluctuate on a daily basis. Those who transfer money from one country to another (from one currency to another) must be up to date on the market's currency exchange rates.

Currency converter (or currency exchange) is a small project written in Java. This streamlined application offers a web-based interface for exchanging/converting money from one currency (say, $) to another (say, â‚¬).
